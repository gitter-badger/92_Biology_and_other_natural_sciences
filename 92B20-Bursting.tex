In neuroscience, {\bf bursting} denotes two or more action potentials (spikes) fired by a neuron, followed by a period of quiescence. A burst of two spikes is called a {\bf doublet}, three spikes - {\bf triplet}, four - {\bf quadruplet}, etc. 

Most mathematical models of bursting can be written in the singularly perturbed form
\[
\begin{matrix} 
\dot{x}  = \  f(x, y) & \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{(fast spiking)} \\ 
\dot{y}  =  \mu g(x, y) & \mbox{(slow modulation)}
\end{matrix}
\]
where $x \in {\mathbb R}^n$ is the fast variable that simulates fast spiking of the neuron, and $y \in {\mathbb R}^m$ is the slow variable that modulates such spiking activity.

A topological classification of bursters relies on the bifurcations of the fast subsystem (variable $x$) when the slow subsystem (variable $y$) is treated as a parameter.
